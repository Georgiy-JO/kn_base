## Connected files
- `.gitignor` - list of files to avoid tracking by git.
- `.gitattributes` - specifically formatted list of types of big files to be pushed the special way.  
- `.gitkeep` - empty file put into empty folder to make it tracked by git.

## Special situations

### Erasing previous commits in remote repository
Can be useful if making repository with sensitive information public.

1. Go to desired commit:
```
git checkout <your_commit_hash>
```
2. Go down to the initial commit(*) leaving all current changes:
```
git reset <intial_commit_hash_here> --soft
```
3. Then commit with amend option:
```
git commit --amend -m"My new initial commit"
```
4. Push to your public repository(*):
```
git push <your_remote> <branch_name>
```
* The original change history will still be available with ```git reflog``` locally but will not be pushed to remote repository.

* To get the id of the first commit use the command from this answer:
```
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
```
* There will be conflict if you are pushing to an already existing branch of the remote repository. That can be by-passed by pushing into new branch, and then deleting the old one and renaming new one accordingly.

### Renaming a branch in web github
In case you renamed a branch you are locally using in web github page.
```
git branch -m <old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>
git fetch <your_remote>
git branch -u <your_remote>/<new_branch_name> <new_branch_name>
git remote set-head <your_remote> -a
```
* Example:
    ```
    git branch -m main_1 main
    git fetch origin
    git branch -u origin/main main
    git remote set-head origin -a
    ```

### Work with large files

#### Installation 
To be able to push large files you need to [install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
1. Install package:
```bash
#fedora, etc
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
sudo yum install git-lfs
#ubuntu, etc.
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```
2. ```git lfs install```
#### Tweaking repository
In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your `.gitattributes` file in main directory). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.
* Example:
```bash
git lfs track "*.psd"
```
