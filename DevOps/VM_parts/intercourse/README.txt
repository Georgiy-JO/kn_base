This folder is used to mount with virtual machines.

How to mount:
Sure, here are the steps to mount an Ubuntu folder to a Host Machine in VirtualBox:

Open VirtualBox and select the Guest Machine you want to mount the folder on.
Go to "Settings" and then "Shared Folders".
Click on the "Add" button (the folder with a plus sign) to add a new shared folder.
In the "Add Share" dialog box, select the "Folder Path" on the Host Machine that you want to share.
Specify a "Folder Name" for the shared folder (e.g. "sharedfolder").
Check the "Auto-mount" and "Make Permanent" options.
Leave the "Mount point" field blank.
Click "OK" to save the shared folder settings.
Start the Guest Machine.

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/my_shared_folder	#mnt is not mandatory
sudo mount -t vboxsf my_shared_folder /mnt/my_shared_folder	#mnt is not mandatory
